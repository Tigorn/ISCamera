# ISCamera
This project is just my experiment with camera.
#### Main concept: make framework, that  takes routine work with camera for itself and also provides callbacks for customizing output. Camera manager should be build with small building blocks, according with SRP, so that they can be easily interchanged.

## Todo:
+ Optimisation (use single context for filtering and rendering)
+ More orientations support (now only portrait)
+ Recording Live Photo with filter
